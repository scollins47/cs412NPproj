## Max Clique Problem Presentation -- Sammy Collins
## Exact Solution - Matt Andrews
## Approximation - Hafet Abdulle
## Review - Kory Erdmann

Input- Undirected graph, represented as an adjacency list. Vertexes & Edges

N verts
Vertex vertex ( where the two are connected)
example:

A B\
B C\
A C\
D B\
D A\
D C\
E A\

The solution is the subset {A, B, C, D}
As A is connected to B,C,D 
B is connected to A,C,D
C is connected to A,B,D
And D is connected to A,B,C

E is not included in the answer since it is connected to A it is only connected to A and none of the other vertices.
